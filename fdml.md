The .fmdl, or '''F'''ox '''M'''o'''d'''e'''l''', is the format used by models in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It is a Little-Endian format, meaning bytes are written in reverse order of significance.

* 0x2 - 0x3 (uint16): offset.

=== Block 0xC: String Definitions ===

* 0x4 - 0x7 (uint32): Chunk's length.

It is unknown what this block's purpose is. It always contains a single 0x8 byte entry with all 8 bytes having a value of 0x0.
* 0x0 - 0x7 (uint64): Unknown.

=== Block 0x14: Unknown ===
It is unknown what this blocks purpose is. It appears to have a relationship with the LOD faces as nulling one of its float values results in the model displaying the lowest LOD face set in-game. This block always contains a single 0x80 byte entry.
* 0x0 - 0x3: Padding.
* 0x4 - 0x7 (binary32): Unknown. (Note: Nulling this byte causes the model to display the lowest set of LOD faces.)

* 0x20 - 0x23 (uint32): Unknown.
* 0x24 - 0x79: Padding.

=== Block 0x15: Texture Path Hash Definitions ===
This block is just a list of hashed texture paths used by the model. Each entry is 0x8 bytes. To find the hashed name, you need to subtract 0x1568000000000000 from the listed value. I.e. if a listed hash's value is 0x156A45F7164A964B, subtract 0x1568000000000000 to get 0x245F7164A964B. This means the texture's hashed name would be 245F7164A964B.ftex.

=== Block 0x16: String Hash Definitions ===
This block is very similar to the texture path hash definitions section. It contains hashed strings used for things such as the names of the mesh groups used by the model. The legacy hashing algorithm (the algorithm used to calculate filename hashes in Ground Zeroes) is used to calculate these hashes. Each entry is 0x8 bytes.

== Section 0x1 Blocks ==
Section 0x1 is the section in .fmdl files that holds mesh related data. It contains significantly fewer blocks than section 0x0; however, due to the amount of data it contains, it is larger. Block 0x1 is not present in any known models. Block 0x3 is only present in Ground Zeroes' models.

Each block definition in section 0x1 is 0xB bytes and follows the following structure:
* 0x0 - 0x3 (uint32): Block id.
* 0x4 - 0x7 (uint32): Offset.
* 0x8 - 0xA (uint32): Length.
Each id corresponds to the following block:
* 0x0: Material Parameters.
* 0x2: Vertex Buffer.
* 0x3: Strings.

=== Block 0x0: Material Parameters ===
The material parameters block contains the numerical parameters used by the model's material instances. Each parameter is made of a size 4 array of float values (making each entry 0x10 bytes).
* 0x0 - 0xF (binary32[4]): Float values.

=== Block 0x2: Vertex Buffer ===
The vertex buffer block contains data relevant to the model's vertices. It is broken up into three chunks: the position chunk, the additional vertex data chunk, and the face chunk.

==== Position Chunk ====
The position chunk contains the positions of vertices used by each object. Each vertex is 0xB bytes and is written in this structure:
* 0x0 - 0x3 (binary32): X position.
* 0x4 - 0x7 (binary32): Y position.
* 0x8 - 0xA (binary32): Z position.
Every object will have its vertex data aligned by 0x10. This means that if an object's vertex data does not end at a 0x10th position, it will have padding at the end of its vertex data to align it to the 0x10th position.

==== Additional Vertex Data Chunk ====
The additional vertex data chunk contains the normal, UV and bone-weighting information of each vertex. It is divided into "chunks" for each object, with twelve bytes for padding preceding the end of each object, except for the last which has 4 bytes of padding after it. (may need confirmation) The bone weights are each stored in one byte and then divided by 255 to get the final weight. Each bone weight has a corresponding bone group bone id, which links that bone weight to a bone listed in it's bone group in section 0x5. What data is contained in this chunk is based off of the mesh format assignment section and can vary heavily. The following is a list of all known possible variables in the order they may appear:
* (Binary16): Normal x.
* (Binary16): Normal y.
* (Binary16): Normal z.
* (Binary16): Normal w.
* (Binary16): Tangent x.
* (Binary16): Tangent y.
* (Binary16): Tangent z.
* (Binary16): Tangent w.

* (Binary16): Texture U 3.
* (Binary16): Texture V 3.
* (Int8): Unknown weight 0.
* (Int8): Unknown weight 1.
* (Int8): Unknown weight 2
* (Int8): Unknown weight 3.
* (Uint16): Unknown index 0.
* (Uint16): Unknown index 1.
* (Uint16): Unknown index 2.
* (Uint16): Unknown index 3.

==== Face Chunk ====
The face chunk contains the ids of vertices used by its respective object. Each entry is 0x6 bytes and follows this pattern:
* 0x0 - 0x1 (uint16): Vertex 1 id.
* 0x2 - 0x3 (uint16): Vertex 2 id.
* 0x4 - 0x5 (uint16): Vertex 3 id.

=== Block 0x3: Strings ===
The strings block contains the actual string data that is referenced by section 0's block 0xC.
