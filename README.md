# PES Facemod

PES Facemod is a [Blender 2.80](https://www.blender.org/) plugin that allows PES modders to edit Faces and Hair files.

This tool is *heavily* based on the [PES2019 Face-Hair Modifier v1.80b by MJTS](https://evo-web.co.uk/threads/pes2019-face-hair-modifier-v1-80b-by-mjts.80593/). 

## Prerequisites

This tool runs on Blender 2.8x. For Blender 2.79, use the [PES2019 Face-Hair Modifier v1.80b by MJTS](https://evo-web.co.uk/threads/pes2019-face-hair-modifier-v1-80b-by-mjts.80593/).

## Installing PES Facemod

To install, simply download the Zip file from the current release, and install it using the Blender menu. See [Add-ons on Blender.org](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html).

## Using PesFacemod

The basic workflow for this tool is as follows:

* Extract or download an existing face you want to edit.
* Open Blender, go to the Scene Properties, under _PES2020 Face Modifier 2.0_
 select a .fpk file, and press _Import Fpk_
* Modify the geometry of the face inside Blender
* Modify the textures by accesing the PNG files under sourceimages (ignore DDS and FTEX files)
* Finish your work by pressing _Export Fpk_
